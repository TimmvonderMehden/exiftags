Spits out Exif tags from a digital camera JPEG file.  See the included
man page for usage and more information.  If you want to read the
man page before installing it, just do:

    nroff -man exiftags.1

To build the program, type:

    make

To install it (defaults to a prefix of /usr/local):

    make install

It should build fine on FreeBSD and Linux.  If it breaks, please let me
know.  One of these days I'll get around to making it compile under WIN32.

Feel free to use the source within the confines of its BSD license.  Note
that I do not wish it to be relicensed under some other Open Source
license (e.g., GPL).  I would be interested to know if you use parts of
this program in your own and any thoughts you might have on its
improvement.

If you know how to decode unsupported maker note data or are able to
procure definitive information from a manufacturer, I'd love to hear
from you.

Please report bugs, incompatibilities, successes, etc. to
emj@postal.net.  The latest version of this software will be posted
at http://emj.postal.net/software/exifdump/.
