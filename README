exiftags-0.93

Eric M. Johnston, emj@postal.net

This utility spits out Exif tags from a digital camera JPEG file.  See
the included man page for usage and more information.  If you want to
read the man page before installing it, just do:

    nroff -man exiftags.1

To build the program, type:

    make

To install it (defaults to a prefix of /usr/local):

    make install

Included are Visual Studio workspace and project files which should
be sufficient for building under Windows.  To install, just copy
exiftags.exe to some directory in your path (c:\windows\system32 usually
works).

It should build fine on FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris using gcc; on Windows
using Visual C++ 6.0 (and probably others).  Portability patches are
welcomed.  You might have problems with the use of u_int16_t and
u_int32_t.  If so, see exif.h.

Feel free to use the source within the confines of its BSD license.  Note
that I do not wish it to be re-licensed under some other Open Source
license (e.g., GPL).  I would be interested to know if you use parts of
this program in your own and any thoughts you might have on its
improvement.

If you know how to decode unsupported maker note data or are able to
procure definitive information from a manufacturer, I'd love to hear
from you.

Please report bugs, incompatibilities, successes, etc. to
emj@postal.net.  The latest version of this software will be posted
at http://emj.postal.net/sw/exifdump/.
