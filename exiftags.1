.SH NAME
.B exiftags
\- output the properties contained in a JPEG Exif section
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exiftags
[
.B \-acdilquv
] [
.B \-s
.I delim
] [
.I file ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B exiftags
utility parses
.I file
or, by default, its standard input, looking for a JPEG APP1 section
containing Exif (Exchangeable Image File) data.  The properties contained in
these data are then printed to the standard output.

Digital cameras typically add Exif data to the image files they produce,
containing information about the camera and digitized image.  The options
described below may be used to control output verbosity and section
formatting.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -a
Output camera-specific, image-specific, and verbose properties contained in
the file.
.IP -c
Output camera-specific properties contained in the file.
.IP -d
Output Exif parse debug information.
.IP -i
Output image-specific properties contained in the file.
.IP -l
Make lens characteristics image-specific.  Useful for higher-end cameras
that have removable lenses (i.e., not "point-and-shoot" cameras).
.IP -q
Suppress output of a property section header.
.IP -s
Separate field name and value with the string
.IR delim  .
The default is ': '.
.IP -u
Output unknown or unsupported properties contained in the file.
.IP -v
Output verbose properties contained in the file.
.SH MAKER NOTES
Some camera manufacturers include a "maker note" section with additional
information about the camera or image not part of the Exif standard.
The format of these maker notes varies wildly and manufacturers are not
forthcoming with implementation details.  Therefore,
.B exiftags
maker note support is the result of experimentation and reverse engineering
(see below for credits) and incomplete.
.B exiftags
is known to have at least partial support for the following manufacturers'
maker notes:
.IP "" 4
Canon
.br
Casio
.br
Fujifilm
.br
Minolta
.br
Nikon
.br
Olympus
.PP
If you wish support for additional
manufacturers or cameras, please send any information you have
about the data format or, better yet, patches, and a sample image file
to the author.  (Though he makes no promises.)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The
.B exiftags
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
exifcom(1)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.B exiftags
utility was developed using the January 2002 Exif standard, version 2.2
(http://tsc.jeita.or.jp/avs/data/cp3451.pdf) and the June 1992
TIFF specification, revision 6.0
(http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/TIFF6.pdf).
.SH BUGS
Not all Exif 2.2 properties are supported, due either to the author's laziness
or incomplete information.  Maker note support is spotty due to lack of
information.
.SH AUTHOR
The
.B exiftags
utility and this man page were written by Eric M. Johnston <emj@postal.net>.
Portions of the utility were developed while referencing the public domain
Jhead utility, version 1.2, by Matthias Wandel <mwandel@rim.net>.
Maker note support is largely the result of TsuruZoh Tachibanaya's
compendium (http://www.ba.wakwak.com/~tsuruzoh/Computer/Digicams/exif-e.html)
and its contributers.  Minolta maker note support was contributed by
Javier Crespo <jcrespoc@dsland.org>.
